## üìù Introduction
This script is written in Python 3.13 on Windows 11 and has not been tested in any other environments.

The program receives in input a user's name (name.surname@domain.it) and password.

The input will be processed, in case Azure Active Directory truncates the user name as it supports a max of 20 characters.

The credentials will then be sent to the Domain Controller to be checked and will return either a True (the credentials are valid) or a False (the credentials are not valid).

After the validation, the script will check the excel files for a match of the user's name and surname and retrieve their VM name.

Once the VM name is found, the program will get connection to the vCenter to find a match of the VM name within the list.

Finally, after a match is found, the user's VM will be turned on and the script will end.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
To set up your environment to use the program, run the following command in a terminal:

```sh
# On Windows
git clone https://github.com/dynital/vm_power_on.git
cd .\vm_power_on\
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```sh
# On Linux
git clone https://github.com/dynital/vm_power_on.git
cd .\vm_power_on\
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv\bin\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîß Configuration
The needed configurations on the program can be found and customized in config.py, which looks like this

```py
# Azure Active Directory (AAD) configuration
AAD_TENANT_ID = "your_tenant_id"
AAD_CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"

# vCenter configuration
VCENTER_HOST = "your_vcenter_host"
VCENTER_USER = "your_vcenter_user"
VCENTER_PASSWORD = "your_vcenter_password" # HIGHLY RECOMMENDED NOT TO USE

# Excel folder path
EXCEL_FOLDER = "path_to_excel_folder"
```
